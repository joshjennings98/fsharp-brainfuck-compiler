# fsharp-brainfuck-to-C
Transpile Brainfuck to C. Implemented in F#.

This code is purposefully written quite verbosely since brainfuck compilers have been made that are only 100 - 200 bytes so there is no point in making it super small, may as well make it readable.

To Do: 
* Probably account for wrapping of bytes
* Add compile arguments for brainfuck such as array size.
* Turn into something actually usable without just modifying the test variable at the bottom of the file
* Do a write up in the readme
